                    If you are a BITS Pilani student enrolled in the course, and haven't already been added to
                    Slack, please contact the instructors. If you're outside BITS Pilani, we're sorry we won't be
                    able to accomodate you currently.

                below for some details. Some excerpts (which we will provide during the course) will be taken from:
                <li>Learn Python 3 The Hard Way by Zed Shaw</li>
                <li>Thinking Functionally with Haskell by Richard S. Bird</li>

            <div class="copy">
                There will be very short homeworks after some lectures. You will not be graded on
                them, and you can find them at the end of the respective lecture slides.

                We will post slides on the course website after each lecture.

                All assignments must be turned in on time. We will allow a total of four late days
                cumulatively. We will not make any additional allowances for late assignments: the late days are
                intended to provide for exceptional circumstances, and students should avoid using them unless
                absolutely necessary. Any assignments that are submitted late (with insufficient late days
                remaining) will not be graded.
